# (Forked From) FUTO Keyboard with extra features
## Forked Readme
> # FUTO Keyboard
> The goal is to make a good keyboard that doesn't spy on users. This repository is a fork of [LatinIME (the Android Open-Source Keyboard)](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME).
>
> The code is licensed under the [FUTO Source First License 1.0](LICENSE.md).
>
> Check out the [FUTO Keyboard Wiki](https://gitlab.futo.org/alex/keyboard-wiki/-/wikis/FUTO-Keyboard)
>
> Building
> When cloning the repository, you must perform a recursive clone to fetch all dependencies:
>```
>git clone --recursive https://gitlab.futo.org/alex/latinime.git
>```
>
> You can also initialize this way if you forgot to specify the recursive clone:
>```
>git submodule update --init --recursive
>```
>
> You can then open the project in Android Studio and build it that way.
